<p align="justify">My high school days were done already and now I'm in the next stage of my studies, a new chapter of my life in studying; My College life, this time I will set my new goals in life that I want to achieve as soon as I graduate from my chosen course like after I graduate from my course, I'm planning study again another course. thus, my parents agreed with what I'm planning to do with my life.
</p>
<p align="justify">High School is very different from college. I need to be more responsible enough to manage my time so that I can prevent cramming though during my high school life, I can say that I'm a hard-working student because I'm doing all the tasks that had given to me by my teachers. I must work harder this time, I don't like to have failing grade. thus, during my high school life, I didn't get any failing grade. </p>
<p align="justify">I'm a quiet type of person. some would see me in their first impression like I'm snobber but I'm not. I'm a friendly person and I can easily get friends. My blockmates are my friends they can help me during hard times and they can also be my inspiration to do my very best always.</p>
<p align="justify">I assume that after I graduate from Game Design &amp; Development. I would create my own game and sell it. so, that I could earn my first income and I wouldn't depend on my parents money. thus, I hope that I can have partners in making business as startup or either I could work on a big gaming company.</p>
